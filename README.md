# Portal94
An Emulation of an unreleased Operating System by TechnoFirma.

Hello There. I found this old version of the Portal OS on a floppy disk and I thought it would be fun to use the Co-Pilot to get this thing to run online so that everyone can see what could have been. For safety reasons, I've made it so that I am the only one that can edit files, but I'll try and keep this thing as free as possible so you can explore and see what it was all about. I think at this point it might be considered Abadonware, I also wanted to see if any of the old team see this and swing by. I've kept the old lines of contact open so if you guys want to catch up, then you can find me there (I know Telnet is a lost cause, but there's other ways).
